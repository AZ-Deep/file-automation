#file-automation
This is a basic python program that transfers files to specific folders, e.g., PDF, docs, music, photos and even videos! I made this because I'm having a hard time organizing my documents
and other important files and this solves that because this automatically sorts and organizes files depending on their file type.

##Technologies used
Python
Watchdog

###Installation
You will need watchdog for this so you need to execute this in your terminal:
pip install watchdog

Here's a guide if you like: https://pythonhosted.org/watchdog/

####Usage
File-automation can be useful for people who have little to no time of organizing their files because this program does it automatically for you! Run the program and just watch it while it
works. While running every file in your downloads folder and everything you download from there on will be transferred automatically to their designated folder.

#####Features
Transfers your files in real-time using Watchdog
Automatically renames files to avoid conflict with duplicate names
There are multiple file types supported by the program as of now which are:
- `.docx`, `.txt` → Documents
- `.pdf` → PDFs
- `.mp3`, `.wav` → Music
- `.jpg`, `.png` → Images
- `.mp4`, `.mov` → Videos
